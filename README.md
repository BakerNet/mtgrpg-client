Client for maintaining game state, tracking progress, etc.

### Copyright info

Magic: the Gathering is property of Wizards of the Coast.  Any use of Magic: the Gather art, terms, or lore should fall under Fair Use policy.

MTG RPG not intended to be a commercial product, just a fan-made game which uses Magic: the Gathering cards as a core game mechanic.

## Development Status

VERY EARLY! This is not by any means a working Client at the moment.

Development of backend server has not yet been started.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

If you want to run this yourself, you will need to create an Auth0 Client
Once you create an Auth0 Client, add the info to a file named:
src/app/auth/auth0-variables.ts
using template:
src/app/auth/auth0-variables-example.ts

## Notes

Tests not actually implemented.  Don't bother running ng test
